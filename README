This is your new Play application
=================================

This is a small web-service solution for required test task.
Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to finish all of the specified requirements.
Though, I tried to do my best to provide a quick and solid solution that delivers main mechanics required from the task.

The main entity 'Car' is presented with the following required fields:
uuid - actually sorm creates own Long typed primary key 'id' for H2 DB, though I had some problems with extracting it,
 so I've decided to create another field 'uuid' , which then is used as logic-wise id.
title
fuel
price
new_car

Services provided:
1. list all cars
2. create new car
3. show only one car (by uuid)
4. delete car

- HomeController.scala:
  All requests handling

On front-end side, I used jQuery, Handlebars and Bootstrap.

Simple Tests are used as integration test and application tests.
Those are mainly stubs for future real communication-flow test
