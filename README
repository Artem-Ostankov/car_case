This is your new Play application
=================================

Is a prototype for test task

From requested task I didn't unfortunately had time to finish all the required points.

So the main entity Car is presented with the following required fields:
uuid - actually sorm creates own Long typed primary key 'id' for H2 DB, though I had some problems to extract it,
 so I've decided to create another field 'uuid' , which then is used as logic-wise id.
title
fuel
price
new_car

Services provided:
1. list all cars
2. create new car
3. show only one car (by uuid)
4. delete car

- HomeController.scala:
  All requests handling

On front-end side, I used jQuery, Handlebars and Bootstrap.

Simple Tests are used as integration test and application tests.
Those are mainly stubs for future real communication-flow test
